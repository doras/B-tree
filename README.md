# B-tree
C++ implementation of B-tree and insertion.

## How to Use

Include [the header file](b_tree.hpp) and use the class `B_node`.

You can make new B-tree with B_node initialization, and insert nodes with `insert` static member function.

When print a B-tree, use `print_inorder` static member function.
